# Light automation system (arduino + android)

##The main idea is to control room's light(s) automatically + remotely

####This was a small project for 2 engineering students in thier first year of electerical engineering in SFE (Shoubra faculty of engineering, Egypt) and it consists mainly of 2 parts ...

###Arduino Part
The system would turn the light(s) on when some one enters the room and it would count the people in the room and the light(s) would go off when there is no one in the room.

###Android part
The Android part is that you have full control on every thing from the phone,
you can directly control the light (force on/off) and you can turn the system on/off
You can also manage the system's data, i.e. you can get/set the number of people in the room easily

###An Extra feature
There is a temperature sensor in the system which you can get its value from the phone, because why not :D
